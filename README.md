## Configuration
> This application makes use of `ESLint`, `Stylelint` and `EditorConfig`. Each of these features requires
> an extension be installed in order to work properly with IDEs and text editors such as VSCode.

## Server Environments
> The same Express server handles development and production content. To run the server locally
> with webpack dev middleware, run `npm start`. To run the production server with static
> build assets from 'dist', run `NODE_ENV=production node index.js`.
